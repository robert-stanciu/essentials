Essentials provide **better defaults** for your Laravel applications including strict models, automatically eagerly loaded relationships, immutable dates, and more! 

> **Requires [PHP 8.3+](https://php.net/releases/)**, **[Laravel 11+](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/)**.

> **Note:** This package modifies the default behavior of Laravel. **It is recommended to use it in new projects** or when you are comfortable with the changes it introduces.

## Installation

⚡️ Get started by requiring the package using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

```bash
composer require nunomaduro/essentials
```

## Features

All features are optional and configurable in `config/essentials.php`.

You may publish the configuration file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=essentials-config
```

### ✅ Strict Models

Improves how Eloquent handles undefined attributes, lazy loading, and invalid assignments.

- Accessing a missing attribute throws an error.
- Lazy loading is blocked unless explicitly allowed.
- Setting undefined attributes throws instead of failing silently.

**Why:** Avoids subtle bugs and makes model behavior easier to reason about.

---

### ⚡️ Auto Eager Loading

Automatically eager loads relationships defined in the model's `$with` property.

**Why:** Reduces N+1 query issues and improves performance without needing `with()` everywhere.

---

### 🗺️ Enforce Morph Map

Requires every polymorphic model to be registered in a morph map instead of storing its fully-qualified class name in the database.

**Why:** Decouples your database from your application's class structure, so you can rename or move models without breaking existing polymorphic relationships.

---

### 🔓 Optional Unguarded Models

Disables Laravel's mass assignment protection globally (opt-in).

**Why:** Useful in trusted or local environments where you want to skip defining `$fillable`.

---

### 🕒 Immutable Dates

Uses `CarbonImmutable` instead of mutable date objects across your app.

**Why:** Prevents unexpected date mutations and improves predictability.

---

### 🔒 Force HTTPS

Forces all generated URLs to use `https://`.

**Why:** Ensures all traffic uses secure connections by default.

---

### 🛑 Safe Console

Blocks potentially destructive Artisan commands in production (e.g., `migrate:fresh`).

**Why:** Prevents accidental data loss and adds a safety net in sensitive environments.

---

### 🚀 Asset Prefetching

Configures Laravel Vite to preload assets more aggressively.

**Why:** Improves front-end load times and user experience.

---

### 🔄 Prevent Stray Requests

Configures Laravel Http Facade to prevent stray requests.

**Why:** Ensure every HTTP calls during tests have been explicitly faked.

---

### 😴 Fake Sleep

Configures Laravel Sleep Facade to be faked.

**Why:** Avoid unexpected sleep during testing cases.

### 🏗️ Artisan Commands

#### `make:action`

Quickly generates action classes in your Laravel application:

```bash
php artisan make:action CreateUserAction
```

This creates a clean action class at `app/Actions/CreateUserAction.php`:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Actions;

final readonly class CreateUserAction
{
    /**
     * Execute the action.
     */
    public function handle(): void
    {
        DB::transaction(function (): void {
            //
        });
    }
}
```

Actions help organize business logic in dedicated classes, promoting single responsibility and cleaner controllers.

#### `essentials:pint`

Laravel Pint is included by default in every Laravel project and is a great tool to keep your code clean and consistent. But it is configured very minimally by default. This command will publish a configuration file for Pint that includes the following:

- "declare_strict_types" - Enforces strict types in all files.
- "final_class" - Enforces final classes by default.
- "ordered_class_elements" - Orders class elements by visibility and type.
- "strict_comparison" - Enforces strict comparison in all files.
- and more...

```bash
php artisan essentials:pint {--force} {--backup}
```

*Options:*
- `--force` - Overwrites the existing configuration file without asking for confirmation.
- `--backup` - Creates a backup of the existing configuration file.

#### `essentials:rector`

Rector is a powerful tool for refactoring and improving your codebase. This command will publish a configuration file for Rector that includes the following:

- "deadCode" - Removes dead code from your codebase.
- "codeQuality" - Improves code quality by applying best practices.
- "typeDeclarations" - Adds type declarations to your codebase.
- "privatization" - Privatizes class properties and methods where possible.
- "earlyReturn" - Enforces early return statements in your codebase.
- "strictBooleans" - Enforces strict boolean checks in your codebase.

```bash
php artisan essentials:rector {--force} {--backup}
```

*Options:*
- `--force` - Overwrites the existing configuration file without asking for confirmation.
- `--backup` - Creates a backup of the existing configuration file.


## Configuration

All features are configurable through the `essentials.php` config file. By default, most features are enabled, but you can disable any feature by setting its configuration value to `false`:

```php
// config/essentials.php
return [
    NunoMaduro\Essentials\Configurables\ShouldBeStrict::class => true,
    NunoMaduro\Essentials\Configurables\Unguard::class => false,
    // other configurables...
];
```

You may also publish the stubs used by this package:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=essentials-stubs
```

## Roadmap

- Better defaults before each test case
- Better Pint configuration by default
- General cleanup of the skeleton
- Additional configurables for common Laravel patterns
